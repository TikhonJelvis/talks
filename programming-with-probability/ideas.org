* Why?
  - build probabilistic models
  - understand complex systems
    - risk management
    - optimization
    - ... <find more>

** Supply Chain Optimization
   - stochasticity is *important*
     - demand, supply, lead times, spoilage...
   - stochasticity is *hard*
     - computationally challenging
     - hard to write
     - hard to reason about

* Discrete Probability
  - simple
  - simple abstractions scale more than you'd think
    - worked surprisingly well for supply chain models

** Details
   - <tutorial on Dist monad>

** Random Sampling
   - reuse same program to sample *or* compute distribution
     exhaustively

* Probabilistic Programming
  - "Practical Probabilistic Programming with Monad" paper
  - advances:
    - continuous distributions
      - normal, exponential... etc
    - conditional probability
    - advanced sampling algorithms
