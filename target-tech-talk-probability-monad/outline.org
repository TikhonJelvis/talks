* Programming with Probability

* Outline
  - introduce work
  - why probability distributions matter
  - why Haskell?
  - abstraction for probability distributions
  - examples and motivation for map and >>=
    - do notation
  - two interpretations
    - examples
  - a bit about optimization
    - different optimization methods use different interpretations
  - looking forward: probabilistic programming

* Work
  - supply chain optimization
  - maximize experience; minimize cost
    - minimize inventory without going out-of-stock
  - demand uncertainty
