* MDPs in Haskell
  Alternative title: "A Haskell-Flavored Introduction to RL"

* Haskell to teach abstractions
 "What is a programming language?"   

 Not just a way to tell the computer what to do, but a way to define
 and understand abstractions.

 I like using Haskell to teach abstractions from other fields.
 Haskell's types are a powerful yet simple framework for formalizing
 abstractions.

* The problem: stochastic optimization
  - start with non-stochastic optimization (ie examples from calculus)
  - talk about supply chains and uncertainty
  - we need a different way to define the problems, and a different
    way to solve them

* Markov Process

* Probability Distributions
  - having an abstraction for probability distributions is great!
  - reference probability monad talk
