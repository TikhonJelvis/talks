* Notes
** explain predicates
   - sometimes they're like predicates
   - sometimes they work like constructors
   - talk about compound statements and existing rather than
     predicates per se
* Ideas

** Animations

*** Unification
    - describe unification as comparing "parts" of expressions
    - line up the parts to compare
    - then go through examples, case-by-case
    - talk about occurs check at the very end?

** Occurs Check
   - Show relevant type error
     - =let x = [x]=
   - OCaml can do it!
     - =ocaml -rectypes=
     - =let rec x = [x]=
     - usually useless
     - =Fix=
** Nondeterminism
   - "traingles" animation?
