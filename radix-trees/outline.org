* Tries
  - key-value map
  - read key in part by part
    - branch on part of each key
  - can be simpler and more efficient than binary search trees
** Basic Example
   - definition
   - lookup
   - insert

* Patricia Tries
  - "Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded in
    Alphanumeric"
  - efficient for integer keys
  - Data.IntMap
** Core Idea
   - read key bit-by-bit
   - compress paths
