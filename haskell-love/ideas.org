* A Haskell Introduction to Stochastic Optimization

** What is stochastic optimization?
   Making good decisions under uncertainty.

*** Optimization

*** Reinforcement Learning

*** Examples
    - OR
    - finance

** Why Haskell?
   Great language to make abstract ideas more concrete.

   When I need to learn a new concept, I like to use Haskell as a
   learning tool. Encoding an idea in Haskell helps me understand all
   the details without too much incidental complexity. It isn't
   overwhelming.

** Probability Distributions

** Markov Decision Processes
