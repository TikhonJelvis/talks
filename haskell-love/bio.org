* Tikhon Jelvis
  I like programming languages. A lot. Especially Haskell.

  I'm a member of the Haskell.org committee, I've used Haskell professionally and I've written about it extensively on both Quora and Stack Overflow.

  I developed an interest in stochastic control after spending several years on retail inventory optimization and simulation before switching focus to demand forecasting.
