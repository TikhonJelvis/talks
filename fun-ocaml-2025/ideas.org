* Structure
  1. What are SAT/SMT solvers?
     - Why should you care?
     - Why do they work?
     - How can we use them? (With examples.)
  2. Compiling programs to SMT formulas.
     - Interpreter â†’ formula compiler
     - Bounded verification
     - Program synthesis
  3. DSLs
     - Why DSL tooling can be better/easier.
     - What can you do with DSLs that you can't with "full" languages?
     - Examples?
       - Stream processing
       - Cryptol
