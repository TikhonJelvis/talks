* Programming with Probability

* Outline
  - probability monad
    - abstract
  - different interpretations
    - examples
  - limitations
  - supply chain
    - examples
  - looking forward

* Probability Monad

* Interpretations

** Single Model, Multiple Implementations

** Exhaustive
   - Erwig paper
   - issues: performance
     - binomial example

** Realigned (Codensity)

** Sampling
   - MWC-random
   - stdgen
   - etc

* Supply Chain

** Examples
   - Target background: supply chain, DCs... etc
   - walk through single-node model

** MDPs
   - define MDPs and Markov Chains
   - talk about stochastic optimization
   - bad performance? fine for us, for now!

* Future: Full-on probabilistic programming
  - "Practical Probabilistic Programming with Monads"

** Free Monad

** Continuous Distributions

** Conditional Probability

** Modern PPL algorithms/inference
   - integrate with stochastic optimization?
