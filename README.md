# Talks

Slides, outlines, drafts and miscellanious resources for my talks.

You can find additional resources on [my site](http://jelv.is/talks): recordings, links and slides in HTML or PDF.

The slides are generated from org-mode files that can be compiled to either HTML or LaTeX. They are all released uner a [CC-BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa] license. My newer slides export to [reveal.js][reveal] with [org-reveal]; older ones used a modified version of [`org-html5presentation.el`](https://gist.github.com/509761) that doesn't work any more. (They also didn't work in Firefoxâ€”only Chrome.)

## Talks

In reverse chronological order:

  * `radix-trees`: an overview of tries including PATRICIA tries and Adaptive Radix Trees. Lots of custom diagrams! Given at Target in Sunnyvale for the [Haskell Hackers][hh] meetup.
  * `frp-2016`: a high-level overview of what FRP is and why it matters. Given at the inaugural [East Bay Haskell][eb] meetup.
  * `compose-2016`: using SMT solvers to analyze programs. A high-level tutorial on bounded verification and synthesis given at [Compose 2016][compose] in New York.
  * `graphs-wagon`: an introduction to inductive graphs and the functional graph library, given at the [SF Haskell Meetup][sf].
  * `thinking-with-laziness`: a talk about embracing laziness at [BayHac 2015][bayhac].
  * `nondeterminism`: a talk about using lists for nondeterministic search, given as a lightning talk at Haskell Hackers.
  * `inductive-graphs`: a quick talk about inductive graphs at Haskell Hackers (the SF meetup version is much better).
  * `logic-programming`: some buggy slides for a talk about implementing Prolog in Haskell, given at BayHac 2014.
  * `sfttpl`: a series of talks going from the untyped lambda calculus to dependent types, given over five weeks at the SF Types, Theorems and Programming Languages meetup.
  * `f-algebras`: a lightning talk about algebras and folds at BayHac 2013.
