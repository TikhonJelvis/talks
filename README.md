# Talks

This repository contains sources for slides of a few talks I've given at various meetups, namely San Francisco Theorems, Types and Programming Languages and Haskell Hackers at Hacker Dojo.

You can get compiled HTML and PDF versions on [my site](http://jelv.is/talks).

The talks are all written with org-mode and can be compiled to either HTML or LaTeX.

The HTML export I use is a modified version of [`org-html5presentation.el`](https://gist.github.com/509761) that also depends on `slides.css`. Right now, it doesn't work properly in FireFoxâ€”just Chrome. I haven't tested it on any other browsers.
