* Function Composition
  - =a → b=, =b → c=, =a → c=
  - one function after another
  - directly pass results in between

* Monads
  - **customize** function composition
  - “different shape” of function
  - =a → m b= vs =a → b=
    - =m= is a “slot” to insert custom behavior

* Lists
  - consider =m= as =[]=
  - =a → [b]=, =b → [c]=, =a → [c]=
  - different shape: tree!
